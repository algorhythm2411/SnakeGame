# How to Play
## Start the Game: 
Open the game in your web browser. The game will start with a snake and an apple on the grid.

## Control the Snake:

Use the arrow keys or the WASD keys on your keyboard to control the direction of the snake:
Up Arrow / W: Move up
Down Arrow / S: Move down
Left Arrow / A: Move left
Right Arrow / D: Move right

## Objective: 
Guide the snake to eat apples. 
Each time the snake eats an apple, it grows in length.

## Avoid Collisions: 
The game ends if the snake collides with itself. Navigate carefully to keep growing without running into your own tail.

## Scoring:
Your score increases with each apple the snake eats. The longer the snake, the higher your score.

## Game Over:
If the snake collides with itself, the game is over. A "Game Over" message will be displayed along with your final score.
